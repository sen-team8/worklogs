>Brief: Till now, I have edited and reviewed all the documents which includes the SRS, Project Plan, Project Proposal, SDLC and the Traceability Matrix. Along with that I have taken an interview of an M.Tech students for the purpose of the project. We asked various questions indicating the importance of the project and various features to them. Along with that, I have also helped with the survey that was previously conducted. We required better demographics and analysis of the survey so we decided to redo it.
